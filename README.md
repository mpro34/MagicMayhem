## Systems to Implement (not in order of priority):
- **Different game skin**. More realistic aesthetic to match the weapons.
- **A minimap**. Add a minimap to the HUD. This should show Enemies, Friendlies, weapons, power-ups, and ammo pickups.
- **More advanced hitreactions**. Add bloodspray / more realistc damage based on location of hit. Perhaps add physics.
- **User interface for weapons when near them**. So that you know what you are picking up.
